# RoundRobinCPUScheduling

This is a program to simulate of CPU scheduling algorithms - Round Robin using JavaFX.

This program allow user to enter the details about the processes such as Arrival Time, Burst Time,
Priority, Time Quantum for Round Robin assigned at the beginning of simulation and the
number of processes can range from 3 to 10. Executing this program will show the Gantt chart 
(visual form) of each algorithm.
